          <p>First off thank you for taking time out of your busy day to have a look at my website!!!</p>

          <p>First thing you will learn about me is that I love technology.  Been fascinated by it since I was very young.  I was the kid that every friend and family member after saying hello was a question about their computers.  Which still happens to this day.  I got into programming a little later in my life then most stories you have probably read or heard.  I am in my early thirties and used to work as a records clerk. Then a records manager for two prestigious law firms for eleven years.  At the time I enjoyed it since I was using technology to make the world of paper that lawyers have for their cases manageable.  I was making a good living doing this but after some time I realized my hobby of programming was what I really wanted to pursue.  So I saved for a few years and quit my job as a records manager and went back to school full time.  Living off of nothing but my savings to pay rent and survive.  I did this till I graduated from New York City School of Technology with Magna Cum Laude. </p>
          
          <p>I look at the years spent in records management as a plus for me going forward.  I learned how to manage people with different personalities to get the job done in an efficient manner.  I know how to showing respect for others beliefs and values.  Which is very important when working with others.  I learned how to make employees and myself happy at work by doing meaningful projects.  Being able to schedule my time properly and how to project my voice in a large room.  That last one took me a while to learn, public speaking at first was very hard but now itâ€™s like second nature.</p>

          <p>I am now working as a freelance full stack web developer using Node.js as my base for my web apps and web sites.  I am currently working on a few projects and will update the site as projects go public.  Down the rabbit hole I go into the world of web development.  My story is not even close to being done, I await my new adventures as a Web Developer.  I am very passionate about learning how I can become better at my craft.  And I will keep learning for the rest of my life.</p>
